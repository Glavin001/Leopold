Leopold
=========================

Virtual Assistant for Ubuntu, Mac, Raspberry Pi, and more!

-----

#### Important: Leopold is no longer backwards compatible with [Palaver](https://github.com/JamezQ/Palaver).

-----

## Installation
Run the following Terminal command.
### 1) SSH
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Glavin001/Leopold.git && cd Leopold && ./install
```
#### Troubleshooting
If you receive the following error:
```bash
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```
Then use method 2, `HTTP`, instead.
### 2) HTTP
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glavin001/Leopold.git && cd Leopold && ./install
```
